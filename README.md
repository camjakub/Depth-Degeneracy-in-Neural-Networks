# Depth Degeneracy in Neural Networks
This repository contains the code used to produce the main figures in two papers I have worked on during my Master's degree. My research involves studying the "large depth degeneracy phenomenon" in neural networks, where inputs tend to get more correlated as they treavel through the layers of an initialized network. Networks which exhibit this type of degeneracy may have a hard time distinguishing between inputs, which can lead to poor training performance.

## Angle Evolution
This folder contains a Google Colab notebook which produces the plots in Figure 1 of _Depth Degeneracy in Neural Networks: Vanishing Angles in Fully Connected ReLU Networks on Initialization_ (Jakub and Nica, 2023), which can be found at the following link
